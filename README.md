## React Hooks
- Simple Normal JS Functions given as utility functions to us by React
- Written by Facebook Developers inside the react we imported from npm
- Have some logic in them that brings superpowers in our app
- Mostly used hooks are: 
   - useState() - used 80% of the times
   - useEffect() - used 20% of the times
- Other hooks are also used but have a little less usage as compared to the above 2
