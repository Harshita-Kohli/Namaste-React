# JSX
- Is a Syntax Extension to JS.
- Stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension( not JavaScript XML!!).
- React developers came up with this syntax as the React.createElement() was very complicated in case of generating nested DOM structure.
- It is just an HTML-like/ XML-like syntax but not the same as them.
- It exists independent of React, but can be used in React to write readable and managable code.
- It is eventually converted to React.createElement() syntax by Babel, a package that comes as a dependency of Parcel.
- JSX is not HTML written in JS!!
