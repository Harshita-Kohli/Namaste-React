# React is a Library
Because, we as a developer can decide where to use it in our code. It can even work in just the header or just the footer of the app.

# Difference betweeen Library and Framework 
Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called **Inversion of control**.

- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.
- When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

- A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need.
- A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
- The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how **“opinionated”** it is.
